Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Vera Fl√ºck, and I'm a PhD student in Virology ‚ò£Ô∏è and Bioinformatics üíª at the University of Bern in Switzerland.

I created this website to document my PhD journey in form of blog posts, R analyses and tutorials. I'll be sharing my thoughts, insights, and discoveries as I navigate the world of virology and bioinformatics. Whether you're a fellow scientist, a curious student, or just someone who's interested in the latest developments in this exciting field, I hope you'll find something here that piques your interest. Thanks for reading!
